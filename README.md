============

Basic Associations

1. User
Like most websites, there are users that use the application. They have basic things (name/password/email address). This isn't too excited.

2. Reciple
Users are allowed to have multiple recipes. (This is a referential relationship).

3. Recipe Sale
Users are allowed to have multiple recipe sales. 

Things that will need to be added:
Addresses
Favorites (a.k.a User u likes Recipe r)
Some kind of model that shows the relationship between a user and participating in a sale.
